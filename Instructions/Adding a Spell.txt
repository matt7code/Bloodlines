1.) Open specials/specials.db
    a.) Add the special script name to this list (or uncomment it) eg. spell_burn

2.) Create a new script or edit the existing script matching the above name in /specials
    a.) Write that script using the below commands:

        # Reminder: Enemy is ID# 0-14
        # Reminder: Party is ID# 15-21
        # Examples:

        START
        END

        PROP 22 LOAD 0
        PROP 22 ADD_FRAMES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        PROP 22 SET_STYLE OSCILLATE
        PROP 22 SET_FRAME 0
        PROP 22 SET_FRAMETIME 0.0333333
        PROP 22 UNLOAD

        SELECT ACTOR
        SELECT TARGET
        SELECT 16

        (First SELECT the active prop.)
        ANIMATE START
        ANIMATE START ALL
        ANIMATE STOP
        ANIMATE STOP ALL
        ANIMATE SET_INDEX 0
        ANIMATE SET_NAME UpDown
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE END
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE LOOP
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE OSCILLATE
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE OSCILLATE FORWARD
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE OSCILLATE BACK

        SPRITE MOVE 7 -7
        SPRITE PLACE 300 450
        SPRITE SHOW
        SPRITE HIDE
        SPRITE SCALE x y
        SPRITE RECOLOR r g b a
        SPRITE ROTATE <relative angle>
        SPRITE ROTATION <angle to set rotation to>
        SPRITE RECTANGLE <left top width height>

        WAIT 1.0f
        WAIT ANIM

        eg.
        This loads the initial sprite from graphics/spells.png, a prop without a sprite makes no sense.
        It uses a 'prop index' of 22, which is the first available prop index after the last party member slot.
        PROP 22 LOAD 0
        If the prop is animated, add other sprites to the prop. All sprites in the spells.png are 32x32, and
        counted from 0 to (spells.png.getsize(x)/32)*(spells.png.getsize(y)/32). The cells are counted from left to right,
        then top to bottom.
        PROP 22 ADD_FRAMES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        Add as many props as you'd like counting up from 22.
        If the prop itself is animated, set it's animation style.
        PROP 22 SET_STYLE END
        If you need to select a prop other than the most recently loaded, do so like this:
        PROP SELECT 22
        Manipulate the props animation.
        ANIMATE SET_NAME fly_forward
        Set the animations behavior, will it loop, oscillate forward or back, or simply end?
        ANIMATE SET_STYLE END
        Tell the script to start all the animations you've queued.
        ANIMATE START ALL
        Finally set how long the script should be allowed to last with the WAIT command. You can express this durations in seconds,
        eg. 5 seconds would be "WAIT 5.0" or instruct it to wait until all the animations have concluded with WAIT ANIM. If none
        of the animations has style END, the cut scene will expire after 3.0 seconds.
        WAIT ANIM

        That's it for a basic animation.

        Advanced Commands:
        SPRITE PLACE X Y    By default, all props are placed at 960x, 540y to begin with. Here, you can change this setting.
        SPRITE MOVE X Y     This command allows you to move a prop relative to it current position.

    b.) Save the script

3.) Open "combat_cutscene.cpp"
    a.) Navigate to the "Combat_Cutscene::LoadScript()" function.
    b.) Find the spell constant in the switch statement corresponding to the special you wish to add.
    c.) Under the CASE for your spell, add your spell script from step #1, eg.: m_scriptName = "spell_burn";
    d.) Save the file and re-compile.

4.) All done!
